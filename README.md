# Sample Flask Application (Microblog)
This application is based on the tutorial based on Python Web Development based on Flask Framework. I have completed all the tutorial and found out helpful for developing web application.

## What I Learned
- Implementing Sqlite for managing application data.
- User Authentication using Flask-Login.
- Using Web-Forms
- Setting up Mailing Server by Flask-Mail.
- Error Handling
  - Custom Error Pages
  - Email error Messages
  - Logging to a file
- Managing Time-Zone across the application
- Using I18n and I10n for text translation.

## Usage
To run the application simply clone this repository and run:
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the basic requirements for this application.

Run the application, using:
```
(venv) $ flask run
```
This will run your application if you want you can register as new user but if you want you can use existing user listed in `createdusers.txt`.
